		Storytelling for the World
<br></br>
I hope to inspire and motivate future generations by creating captivating stories through film, manga, and multi-media installments. My work uses strong visuals to depict human bodies, emotions, nature, society, and personifications of feelings and ideals. I employ bold, assured lines with deep cuts of positive action through negative space. I capture moments of intense motion and energy with striking colors and high contrasts between lightness and darkness. Often, my work ends up on paper, canvas, and digital screens like on smartphones or computers. I value traditional practices though, so I prefer my work to be in a physical form. I create in graphite, charcoal, ink, video, sometimes painting, and I occasionally practice metalwork and sculpting.
<br></br>
 I aim to create long-form stories. Longform storytelling has many purposes that I see as essential to humanity’s survival. Such stories put our lives in context so we can understand perspectives and worlds that we do not otherwise see. Longform stories help us connect and build bridges, cultures, and futures. That same effect can help produce records of our history. Our most influential, longest lasting stories, like those from mythology, have created a basis for our current way of life by providing context and understanding of how we got here. If for no other reason though, my favorite reason to tell stories is simply for fun, to entertain, and to inspire. I hope to guide the generations towards the future with hope in their hearts and fire in their souls.

	With my manga one shot Heart of Darkness, I aimed to achieve several such functions of a story, one of which is to simply entertain. I did so by providing a cut-and-dry concept and direct goal for the main character. The story centers around the main character Jason who had given up his powers of Darkness in order to live a peaceful life with his wife; however, once she’s stolen by an old ‘friend,’ he has to dig up his old roots and unleash a great darkness within in order to get her back. Additionally, this story is attempting to solidify the identity of committing to a partner in a chaotic world. Jason goes to great lengths in a threatening world all for the sake of his lover. I heighten that message of commitment through the decrepit scenery, energetic depictions of action, extreme contrasts between black and white, and memorable characters with intense expressions.
